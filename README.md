# VListen
# test
<p>     “VListen” is an application that connects an individual to support groups (Offline and Online) and also with a counselor/ doctor. Through this, we will be able to help a person struggling with mental health, physical disabilities, and discrimination of sorts. By connecting with similar support groups, the individual will be able to learn about how to overcome his/her fears. 
What we intend on doing through our app is to give people a platform and a safe space to express themselves and seek comfort from others who are going through similar struggles. It is a place for people to connect and grow together.
